\section{\texorpdfstring{Literature Review
\label{Lit_Review}}{Literature Review }}\label{literature-review}

The concurrent volatile nature of the South African Rand has brought
about a widespread search for the best strategy aimed at protecting
capital against exchange rate volatility. This paper makes use of Baur
and Lucey (\protect\hyperlink{ref-baur2010}{2010}) `s definitions of
so-called `safe havens' and `hedges'. They define a safe haven as an
asset that is negatively related to another asset or groups of assets
during periods of high market volatility. Furthermore, they define a
hedge as an asset that that is negatively related to another asset or
groups of assets, on average. In terms of the South African equity
market, there are various equities that may potentially provide
protection against rand weakness, and hence act as a rand hedge. This is
due to the fact that a significant share of companies listed on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) has significant offshore exposure,
either through selling products and services that are denominated in
foreign currencies, or through significant offshore operations. As a
result, such companies will experience an increase in rand-denominated
revenue during periods where the rand depreciates. In theory, these
increases in revenue should increase the value of these companies and
consequently lead to higher share price valuations. This phenomenon
subsequently results in a positive statistical relationship between the
depreciation of the rand and the appreciation of the relevant share
price, indicating the rand hedge potential of such a share. Another
potential rand hedge strategy involves the purchasing of commodities.
Since commodities are priced in dollars, their value increases as the
rand weakens, hence serving as a hedge against the depreciation of the
rand. Prior research on this topic in South Africa is relatively
limited. Barr, Holdsworth, and Kantor
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-barr2007}{2007}) made use of a regression model
in order to investigate the relationships between the top 40 shares
listed on the JSE and the rand-dollar exchange rate. The findings of
their study imply that certain local equities can be compiled into a
given domestic portfolio that could serve as an effective and consistent
hedge against rand weakness. The same authors applied a GARCH regression
approach in 2007 to study the relation between the same two variables:
the top 40 shares listed on the JSE and the rand-dollar exchange rate.
In this study, their findings indicate significant variations in the
correlations in the correlations between the rand-dollar exchange rate
and various shares. Some shares, however, are identified as effective
hedges against rand depreciation (see Barr, Holdsworth, and Kantor
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-barr2007}{2007})). There exists a vast
international literature on the practical application of studying
co-movements between various financial returns series in an attempt to
hedge an investment portfolio against currency fluctuation. Fang and
Miller (\protect\hyperlink{ref-fang2002}{2002}) employed a bivariate
GARCH-M model in order to study the co-movements between stock market
returns and currency depreciation. Their findings suggest that some
degree of temporal dependence between the conditional variance of
currency depreciation and stock market returns. Mukherjee and Naka
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mukherjee1995}{1995}) and Kearney
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kearney1998}{1998}) find corroborating results,
with their respective findings suggesting a cointegrating relationship
between stock market returns and the exchange rate. The ability to
understand and predict the temporal dependence in the second-order
moments and to control for the second-order temporal persistence of
asset returns, has various financial econometric applications (Bauwens,
Laurent, and Rombouts \protect\hyperlink{ref-bauwens2006}{2006}).
Kennedy and Nourzad (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kennedy2016}{2016}) state
that increased exchange rate volatility leads to a statistically
significant, positive impact on the volatility of stock market returns
when the main sources of financial volatility are controlled for. The
findings of Baur and Lucey (\protect\hyperlink{ref-baur2010}{2010}), who
analysed the time-varying correlations between gold and a collection of
other assets in Germany, the UK and US, suggest that gold serves as a
safe haven for equities in all of these countries. Ciner, Gurdgiev, and
Lucey (\protect\hyperlink{ref-ciner2013}{2013}) employed a DCC model
with GARCH specification in order to determine the hedging ability of
multiple assets against the British pound and US dollar. Their findings
suggest that gold serves as a potential hedge against exchange rate
volatility for both of these two currencies.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Data \label{Data}}{Data }}\label{data}

The data set used in this study includes the daily closing prices of an
array of equties and ETFs which are traded and easily accessible to
investors on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The top 80 stocks, as
measured by total market cap, which traded on at least 90\% of days
between 01/01/2005 and 31/10/2017 were included in the analysis.
Furthermore, an additional 43 ETFs were included. This was then trimmed
to include those ETFs which traded on at least 90\% of the
aforementioned period. A full list of the assets covered in this
analysis can be found in section \ref{appendix} in table \ref{cover}. In
addition to these variables, the ZAR/USD exchange rate is included to be
used as our variable of interest.

The continuously compounded daily sector returns are then calculated by
taking the log difference of each index series, as:

\begin{align}
r _ { i ,t } = \operatorname{ln} ( \frac { p _ { i } ,t } { p _ { i ,t - 1} } ) * 100 
\end{align}

where \(p_t\) represents the closing index price of asset \(i\) at time
\(t\). Taking the first difference of these return series is then
imposed to remove the unit root process evident in the data. This data
is then used in the analysis which follows.

\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}

This study employs two methodologies to investigate which JSE-listed
financial instruments provide the best hedge against volatility in the
Rand exchange rate. The first method utilised is a regression model
(\ref{regression}), following which a Dynamic Conditional Correlation
(DCC) model \ref{dcc} is used to investigate time-varying corellations
between various JSE-listed instruments and the Rand/US Dollar exchange
rate.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Regression Model
\label{regression}}{Regression Model }}\label{regression-model}

A multiple regression approach was employed to investigate the static
correlations between the Rand exchange rate and the various assets and
financial instruments covered in our data set. The initial regression
model, as specified as in equation \ref{eq1}, was run to investigate the
relationship between the assets covered in the data set and the Rand/US
Dollar exchange rate:

\begin{align} 
Return_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 R_t + \epsilon_t \label{eq1}
\end{align}

where \(Return_t\) refers to the first difference of the log returns of
the assets and \(R_t\) to the dlog Rand/US Dollar exchange rate returns
at time \(t\). This specification includes covers all dates within the
data set.

Following these results, the data set was stratified in order to isolate
the analysis to times of high volatility, both positive and negative, in
the Rand exchange rate. This model was specified as follows:

\begin{align} 
Return_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 R.pos.vol_t + \beta_2 R.neg.vol_t + \epsilon_t \label{eq2}
\end{align}

where \(R.pos.vol_t\) and \(R.neg.vol_t\) refer to dates where the Rand
exchange rate experienced periods of high positive and negative
volotility, repectively. The distinction between times of high and
relatively low volatility is important as this study's findings will be
most relevant to investors in times of high unstability in the Rand.
Furthermore, it allows us to minimize noise in the study which may drive
nonsensical results.

\pagebreak

\subsection{DCC Model}\label{dcc-model}

This study utilises a DCC Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive
Conditional Heteroskedasticity (MV-GARCH) approach to isolate the
time-varying conditional correlations between an array of JSE-listed
stocks and ETFs. This technique offers a parsimonious approach to MV
colatility modelling by relaxing the constraint of a fixed correlation
structure which imposed in other modelling techniques. The results of
which allow us to study whether fluctuations in the Rand exchange rate
influence the aforementioned financial instruments. This information can
then be reinterpreted as an indication of the best hedging options
available to investors in the South African market. In contrast to the
regression model, as described in section \ref{regression}, this method
allows us to assess the dynamic hedging potential of the assets covered
in our data set.

The initial step in the DCC modelling process is to obtain univariate
volatility for each series using a GARCH (1,1) process, specified as
follows in \ref{eq3}:

\begin{align} 
  &r_t = \mu + \epsilon_t   \label{eq3}    \\ \notag 
  &varepsilon_t = \sigma_t . z_t \\ \notag
  &\sigma^2_t = \alpha + \beta_1 \epsilon^2_t-1 + \beta_1\sigma^2_t-1 \\ \notag
  &z_t \sim N(0,1) \notag
\end{align}

The dynamic conditional corelations are then estimated using a
log-likelihood approach using the standardised residuals extracted from
the GARCH (1,1) process.

The DCC model can be defined as:

\begin{align}
H_t = D_t.R_t.D_t \label{eq4}
\end{align}

where \(H_t\) is the conditional covariance matrix of the stochastic
process, \(D_t\) is a diagonal matrix and \(R_t\) refers to the
time-varying correlations between assets. Equation \ref{eq4} seperates
the variance covariance matrix into identical diagonal matrices and an
estimate of the time-varying correlation between assets.

Estimating \(R_t\) requires it to be inverted in each time period, for
which we use a proxy equation as in Engle
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-engle2002}{2002}):

\begin{align}
Q _ { i j ,t } &= \overline { Q } + a ( z _ { t - 1} z ^ { \prime } t _ { t - 1} - \overline { Q } ) + b ( Q _ { i j ,t - 1} - \overline { Q } )   \label{eq5} \\ \notag
 &= ( 1- a - b ) \hat { Q } + a z _ { t - 1} z _ { t - 1} ^ { \prime } + b .Q _ { i j ,t - 1} \notag
\end{align}

Equation \ref{eq5}'s form is similar to that of a GARCH(1,1) process,
with non-negative scalars \(a\) and \(b\), \(Q _ { i j ,t }\) the
unconditional sample variance estimate between series \(i\) and \(j\),
and the unconditional matrix of standardized residuals from each
univariate pair estimate \(\overline { Q }\).We then use equation
\ref{eq5} to esimate \(R_t\) as:

\begin{align}
R _ { t } = \operatorname{diag} ( Q _ { t } ) ^ { - 1/ 2} Q _ { t } \cdot \operatorname{diag} ( Q _ { t } ) ^ { - 1/ 2} \label{eq6}
\end{align}

with the following bivariate elements,

\begin{align}
R _ { t } = \rho _ { i j ,t } = \frac { q _ { i } ,j ,t } { \sqrt { q _ { i i } ,t \cdot q _ { j } j ,t } } 
\end{align}

The resulting DCC model is then formulated as:

\begin{align}
\epsilon _ { t } &\sim N ( 0,D _ { t } \cdot R _ { t } \cdot D _ { t } ) \label{eq7}  \\ \notag
D^2_t &\sim Univariate\quad GARCH(1,1) \quad process \quad \forall (i,j),\quad i \ne j \\ \notag
z _ { t } &= D _ { t } ^ { - 1} \cdot \epsilon _ { t } \\ \notag
Q _ { t } &= \overline { Q } ( 1- a - b ) + a ( z _ { t } ^ { \prime } z _ { t } ) + b ( Q _ { t - 1} ) \\ \notag
R _ { t } &= \operatorname{Diag} ( Q _ { t } ^ { - 1} ) \cdot Q _ { t } .\operatorname{Din} g ( Q _ { t } ^ { - 1} )
\end{align}

Fitting this technique to our data implies a two-step approach. First, a
univariate GARCH model is applied to the residuals of each of our VAR
series' residuals \(\alpha_t = z_t - \mu_t\). The volatility series
\(h_t\) is then estimated in step 2. These volatility series are then
standardized (see equation \ref{eq8} below) and used in fitting a DCC
model for \(\eta _ { t }\).

\begin{align}
\eta _ { i ,t } = \frac { \alpha _ { i ,t } } { \sigma _ { i ,t } } \label{eq8}
\end{align}
