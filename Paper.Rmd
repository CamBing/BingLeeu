# Introduction \label{Introduction}

# Literature Review \label{Lit_Review}

The concurrent volatile nature of the South African Rand has brought about a widespread search for the best strategy aimed at protecting capital against exchange rate volatility. This paper makes use of @baur2010 's definitions of so-called ‘safe havens’ and ‘hedges’. They define a safe haven as an asset that is negatively related to another asset or groups of assets during periods of high market volatility. Furthermore, they define a hedge as an asset that that is negatively related to another asset or groups of assets, on average.
In terms of the South African equity market, there are various equities that may potentially provide protection against rand weakness, and hence act as a rand hedge. This is due to the fact that a significant share of companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) has significant offshore exposure, either through selling products and services that are denominated in foreign currencies, or through significant offshore operations. As a result, such companies will experience an increase in rand-denominated revenue during periods where the rand depreciates. In theory, these increases in revenue should increase the value of these companies and consequently lead to higher share price valuations. This phenomenon subsequently results in a positive statistical relationship between the depreciation of the rand and the appreciation of the relevant share price, indicating the rand hedge potential of such a share. Another potential rand hedge strategy involves the purchasing of commodities. Since commodities are priced in dollars, their value increases as the rand weakens, hence serving as a hedge against the depreciation of the rand. 
Prior research on this topic in South Africa is relatively limited. @barr2007 made use of a regression model in order to investigate the relationships between the top 40 shares listed on the JSE and the rand-dollar exchange rate. The findings of their study imply that certain local equities can be compiled into a given domestic portfolio that could serve as an effective and consistent hedge against rand weakness. The same authors applied a GARCH regression approach in 2007 to study the relation between the same two variables: the top 40 shares listed on the JSE and the rand-dollar exchange rate. In this study, their findings indicate significant variations in the correlations in the correlations between the rand-dollar exchange rate and various shares. Some shares, however, are identified as effective hedges against rand depreciation (see @barr2007). 
There exists a vast international literature on the practical application of studying co-movements between various financial returns series in an attempt to hedge an investment portfolio against currency fluctuation. @fang2002 employed a bivariate GARCH-M model in order to study the co-movements between stock market returns and currency depreciation. Their findings suggest that some degree of temporal dependence between the conditional variance of currency depreciation and stock market returns. @mukherjee1995 and @kearney1998 find corroborating results, with their respective findings suggesting a cointegrating relationship between stock market returns and the exchange rate. 
The ability to understand and predict the temporal dependence in the second-order moments and to control for the second-order temporal persistence of asset returns, has various financial econometric applications [@bauwens2006]. @kennedy2016 state that increased exchange rate volatility leads to a statistically significant, positive impact on the volatility of stock market returns when the main sources of financial volatility are controlled for. The findings of @baur2010, who analysed the time-varying correlations between gold and a collection of other assets in Germany, the UK and US, suggest that gold serves as a safe haven for equities in all of these countries. @ciner2013 employed a DCC model with GARCH specification in order to determine the hedging ability of multiple assets against the British pound and US dollar. Their findings suggest that gold serves as a potential hedge against exchange rate volatility for both of these two currencies.

#  Methodology
This study employs two methodologies to investigate which JSE-listed financial instruments provide the best hedge against volatility in the Rand exchange rate. The first method utilised is a regression model (\ref{regression}), following which a Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model \ref{dcc} is used to investigate time-varying corellations between various JSE-listed instruments and the Rand/US Dollar exchange rate. 

## Regression Model \label{regression}

A multiple regression approach was employed to investigate the static correlations between the Rand exchange rate and the various assets and financial instruments covered in our data set. The initial regression model, as specified as in equation \ref{eq1}, was run to investigate the relationship between the assets covered in the data set and the Rand/US Dollar exchange rate:

\begin{align} 
Return_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 R_t + \epsilon_t \label{eq1}
\end{align}

where $Return_t$ refers to the first difference of the log returns of the assets and $R_t$ to the dlog Rand/US Dollar exchange rate returns at time $t$. This specification includes covers all dates within the data set.

Following these results, the data set was stratified in order to isolate the analysis to times of high volatility, both positive and negative, in the Rand exchange rate. This model was specified as follows:

\begin{align} 
Return_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 R.pos.vol_t + \beta_2 R.neg.vol_t + \epsilon_t \label{eq2}
\end{align}

where $R.pos.vol_t$ and $R.neg.vol_t$ refer to dates where the Rand exchange rate experienced periods of high positive and negative volotility, repectively. The distinction between times of high and relatively low volatility is important as this study's findings will be most relevant to investors in times of high unstability in the Rand. Furthermore, it allows us to minimize noise in the study which may drive nonsensical results.

## DCC Model

This study utilises DCC Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (MV-GARCH) to isolate the time-varying conditional correlations between an array of JSE-listed stocks and ETFs. This technique offers a parsimonious approach to MV colatility modelling by relaxing the constraint of a fixed correlation structure which imposed in other modelling techniques. The results of which allow us to study whether fluctuations in the Rand exchange rate influence the aforementioned financial instruments. This information can then be reinterpreted as an indication of the best hedging options available to investors in the South African market. In contrast to the regression model, as described in section \ref{regression}, this method allows us to assess the dynamic hedging potential of the assets covered in our data set.
